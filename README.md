Lab 4
6.5.17

Three html and one css file decide the layout of bbthorne.github.io and its
extensions.
        - index.html is the main page, and includes my name, a picture of me,
          and 2 links: one to the bio page and the other to the resume page.
        - bio.html includes a short biography about myself. This is located at
          bbthorne.github.io/bio
        - resume.html contains a copy of my resume. This is located at
          bbthorne.github.io/resume
        - styling.css gives styling rules for all html files, with an emphasis
          on the resume page, which gives different attributes to different
          entries in the resume.

The pages all satisfy the instructions in the specification.
This lab took me about 5 hours to complete.
