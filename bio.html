        <h1>Ben Thorne: Bio</h1> <br />
        <p>
        Hello, curious internet-user. My name is Ben Thorne, I come from
        Massachusetts, and I am a Computer Science major at Tufts. Even though
        I study CS primarily, I like to explore a diverse selection of topics.
        At Tufts, I play saxophone in the band Dirty Nalgene, play Ultimate
        Frisbee, and go on trips with the Tufts Mountain Club. I'm also
        part of Tufts Wilderness Orientation (TWO), a program that welcomes
        incoming Tufts students to the community through 5-day backpacking
        trips. <br />
        I've been playing saxophone since I was 10 years old, in a variety of
        styles ranging from classical, to jazz, to hip-hop and fusion. Dirty
        Nalgene jams all around Tufts, so watch out for our next performance :-).
        I've also been hiking and skiing from an early age, and recently started
        rock climbing, which is a fun new way to enjoy the outdoors. I'm super
        excited for the TWO trip that I'll be leading at the end of the summer,
        which will not only be an adventure for me but also for the new students
        in my group. <br />
        Before Tufts, I spent time with my family biking, hiking, skiing,
        hanging with our dogs, and listening to the Grateful Dead. I also
        played semi-competitive badminton in high school and sailed almost every
        day in the summer. Even though I've spent most of my life in
        Massachusetts, I was actually born in Arizona and lived in Connecticut
        for 2 years.
